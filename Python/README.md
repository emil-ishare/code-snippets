For Python, we have simple code fragments and a small package.

The package (iSHARE.basics) contains some very basic functions, such as
  - creating a client_assertion
  - getting an access token from an iSHARE Party using its /token endpoint and EORI
  - getting an access token from an iSHARE Party using its EORI and using the party information stored at Scheme Owner

These functionalities are shown in examples_iSHARE_basics_package.py
